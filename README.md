# Lights out solver

CLI program created in Rust to solve [Lights out puzzle](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LightsOutPuzzle.html).

It finds the minimal solution and you aswell run in simulation mode to check that the board is going to look after a number of steps.
## Usage/Examples of flags

### Help
In order to read the documentation use `--help`
```sh
$ los --help
Lights Out Puzzle Solver 1.2.0
With the given input of on node it will output the order to toggle the lights to solve the puzzle

USAGE:
    los [OPTIONS] [--] [lights]...

ARGS:
    <lights>...    Indexes of the active lights (range from 1 to [cols]*[rows])

OPTIONS:
    -c, --cols <cols>            The number of columns [default: 3]
    -d, --display <mode>         Sets the way you display the results [default: draw] [possible
                                 values: simple, draw, all]
    -h, --help                   Print help information
    -i, --input <mode>           Changes where the first index is located in the matrix (eg: bl =
                                 bottom left) [default: bl] [possible values: tl, tr, bl, br]
    -r, --rows <rows>            The number of rows [default: 3]
    -s, --simulate <steps>...    Run a simulation with the given input
    -v, --verbose                Enable the debug logs
    -V, --version                Print version information
```

By default you just give the position of the lights that are on and in response you get what lights you need to toggle.
```cmd
$ los 7 9 1 3
#·#
·0·
#·#
```
### Simulation

In order to run a simulation just use `-s` in this case the '#' character represents a light on.
```cmd
$ los -s 1 2 3
···
###
·#·
```

### Size

To change the size of the board just set the number of columns or rows using the `-c` and `-r` flag

```cmd
$ los -c 4 -r 4

0123
4··5
6789
····
```

### Input mode

The input mode tells the origin of the indices so we can tell where to start counting. In this case there are 4 possible values: tl, tr, bl and br. Each one of them telling if the first index is at the top left, top right and so on.

Example of the indices for the different modes

```
tl
123
456
789 

tr
321 
654
987

bl
789
456
123

br
987
654
321

```

In this case the default value is `bl` (bottom left) it's done like that you can easily input a 3x3 board using just your num pad.

### Display

You can get the solution of the puzzle in 2 ways as a list of indices or as a drawn matrix where the numbers tell the order to trigger the lights and `#` is an on light and `·` an off light.

### Verbose

Note that you can also enable verbose mode with the `-v` flag

<summary>$ los -v 7 9 1 3</summary>
    
```cmd

And you can aswell use `-v` to see the board after each step in the simulation
